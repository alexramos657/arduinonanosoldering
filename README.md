# Arduino Nano Pin Soldering + Test Circuit

<h2>Overview</h2>
In this project, I soldered male header pins onto an Arduino Nano to prepare it for breadboard prototyping. After verifying solid connections and alignment, I created a simple test circuit to confirm functionality by wiring an LED with a current-limiting resistor to one of the digital output pins. This ensured the board was correctly powered and ready for future development.

I'm still learning so the solder isn't the cleanest, however connectivity was established.
